=Throttle=
--- ldzz772--
For takeoff, the A/T function is engaged by pressing the TO/GA levers on the thrust levers (for Boeing aircraft).
The A/T arm switch is on the glareshield....and the A/T button is for re-engaging the autothrottles inflight.

4) It's a bit more complicated that that....the A/T is tied to the FMC for the takeoff phase and it commands the desired thrust. It does not control speed at the moment. Speed is controlled by changing the pitch attitude.

5) Disengaging the A/T will have no effect on speed control....it's a separate system...

Depends on what aircraft.....for a fly-by-wire aircraft, there will be some protection....
For a conventional aircraft, yes it will allow you

A real throttle is a physical device that is pushed forward and back.

If the aircraft is under auto-throttle, then the engine thrust and the position of levers are controlled by aircraft system.

This needs to a pot like device which fires input to FG. FG accepts the range 0 to 1 (To be confirmed) 

To control engine power and throttle the following modes can by applied
 * "manual" mode - ie commanded by the pilots and throttle position
 * Indicated Air Speed (IAS).  This commands the aircraft to maintain a speed, eg 200 knots , so whether climbing or desceding, the engines will be throttled up or down. The thrust levers will move accordinglly, even in fly by wire.
 * reverse thrust - another issue for later

In outs
 * analog out = throttle pot sends value to FG  (does this need to go thru arduino)
 * analog in = thrust level position

This picture below shows a commanded speed of 133knts, the "speed" button switches the autothrottle on or off.

Autothrottle Button
 * switch and digital OUT  with indicator light > tips switch in FG
 * possible indicator back from FG on Autothrottle state.

IAS

 * digital in = light for auto throttle << we dont need this
 * a rotary switch that goes from around 80 to max speed and a press action to make it active
 * a digital led that displays the speed setting
 * reverse thrust input as analog

==Advice from real pilot required==
Not sure how the Authothrottle is set. However from observation the following scenario could be applied.
 * before take off, the pilots set the IAS to for example 200 knots
 * they take off manual throttle
 * once in the air and safe hight, the auto throttle button is pressed and the aircraft will then accelerate/decellerate to the IAS.
 * if the pilots need to change speed, they twist the knob which changes the IAS display to say 250,
 * the knob is then Pushed, and this command's the aircraft to new speed.
