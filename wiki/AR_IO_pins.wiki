#summary Ideas for pin usage

= Introduction =

We have 
six analog inputs
and 14 digital as either IN or OUt


==6 Analog Ports==
 # - Throttle
 # - pitch
 # - brakes
 # - mixture
 # - rudder pedals
 # - ?


==Digital Ports==
 # Autopilot on
 # altitude hold
 # speed hold
 # speed ? 

=Throttle=
This is assumed to be a pot like device which fires input to FG. 
It also needs to move physically as the aircraft may be in autopilot. 
To control throttle is either in 
 * "manual" mode, 
 * else its in "IAS" hold.  IAS is a switch to enable, and the speed needs to be a rotary switch with led display above.
 * reverse thrust

 * analog out = speed
 * analog in = movment
 * digital out = switch for autothrottle
 * digital in = light for auto throttle << we dont need this
 * a rotarty switch that goes from around 80 to max speed and a press action to make it active
 * reverse thrust input as analog

=Parking Brakes=
Either ON or off
 * single digital input to FG
 * single digital Out to big red bulb from Fg

=Landing gear=
 * Gear Up/Down switch > digital in to ardiono
 * Landing gear lights < from FG < tri state, down/intermideatte/up
