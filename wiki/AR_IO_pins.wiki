We have 
six analog inputs
and 14 digital as either IN or OUt


==6 Analog Ports==
 # - Throttle
 # - pitch
 # - brakes
 # - mixture
 # - rudder pedals
 # - ?


==Digital Ports==
 # Autopilot on
 # altitude hold
 # speed hold
 # speed ? 

=Throttle=
This is assumed to be a pot like device which fires input to FG. 
It also needs to move physically as the aircraft may be in autopilot. 
To control throttle is either in 
 * "manual" mode, 
 * else its in "IAS" hold.  IAS is a switch to enable, and the speed needs to be a rotary switch with led display above.
