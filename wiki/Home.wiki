A playground for interfacing Arduino and Flight Gear. Both projects are open source, are popular and underactive development.

 * *[Arduino]* - is a microcontroller at [http://www.arduino.cc/ arduino.cc]
 * *[FlightGear Flight Gear]* - is flight simulator at [http://wiki.flightgear.org flightgear.org]


==Collaboration Enviroment==
How to make them work together is the interesting part, so after some research on the environment the following has been setup to at leaset get started.

 * *wiki* - Here on google code which your looking at
 * *issues* - Issue tracker here on google code
 * *code* - the code is hosted at github.com - *http://github.com/ac001/fg-arduino/*

Planning. Where do we go from here, what do we want to do with Arduino and Flight Gear?
