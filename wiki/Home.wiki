A playground for interfacing Arduino and Flight Gear. Both projects are open source, are popular and underactive development.

 * *[Arduino]* - is a microcontroller at [http://www.arduino.cc/ arduino.cc]
 * *[FlightGear Flight Gear]* - is flight simulator at [http://wiki.flightgear.org flightgear.org]


==Collaboration Enviroment==
How to make them work together is the interesting part, so after some research on the environment the following has been setup to get started.

 * *fg-ardunio* project here on code.google.com. This is for wiki and issues.
 * *fg-arduino* code hosting at github.com - http://github.com/ac001/fg-arduino/
 * [User_pedro_hosting_why] Why the above combination] and any other ideas are welcome.

Planning. Where do we go from here, what do we want to do with Arduino and Flight Gear?

==Flight==
Lets start with a typical hypothetical basic training aircraft and the minimum control surfaces required to achieve flying and landing.
 * Engine start
 * Brakes
 * Throttle
 * Rudder
 * Yoke 
 * Flaps
 * maybe landing gear, wipers, etc etc

==Arduino==
An Arduino board eg the Duemilanove http://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardDuemilanove has 
 * 14 digital pins configurable as either input or output
 * 6 analog inputs (analog output is by using a digital pin with http://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/PWM)
 * An USB connector to interface with a PC (also provides power)
