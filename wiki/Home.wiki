A playground for interfacing Arduino and Flight Gear. Both projects are open source, are popular and underactive development.

 * *[Arduino]* - is a microcontroller at [http://www.arduino.cc/ arduino.cc]
 * *[FlightGear Flight Gear]* - is flight simulator at [http://wiki.flightgear.org flightgear.org]


The idea at the moment is to document each "control" so they their inputs/outouts can be selected as required and used as interfaces.

There is a limitation with the number of Arduino ports that are available, and their interaction with flightgear.

Some of the controls are documentated as to their behaviour.
