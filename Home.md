A playground for interfacing Arduino and Flight Gear. Both projects are open source, are popular and underactive development.

  * **[Arduino](Arduino.md)** - is a microcontroller at [arduino.cc](http://www.arduino.cc/)
  * **[Flight Gear](FlightGear.md)** - is flight simulator at [flightgear.org](http://wiki.flightgear.org)


The idea at the moment is to document each "control" so they their inputs/outouts can be selected as required and used as interfaces.

There is a limitation with the number of Arduino ports that are available, and their interaction with flightgear.

Some of the controls are documentated as to their behaviour.
